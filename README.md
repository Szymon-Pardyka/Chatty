# Chatty

To run scripts in repo you need to install all the packages
from the imports at the top of scripts. 

If you install them and they are still underlined in red
don't worry, it often bugs.

Uncomment 6th line on train.py script and when prompt shows up
go to Corpora section and download wordnet packages. On further runs
you should comment out this line.

intents.json file contains all the training data
classes and words.pickle files are used to train model and should not be edited
chatbot_model.h5 file contains trained model ready to use in other scripts
